    "Investigating galactic mean-field dynamos stems from a quest to comprehend the emergence and progression of magnetic fields within galaxies. Studying this dynamo is significant because it offers a framework to understand how galactic motions and turbulence are converted into magnetic fields. This knowledge sheds light on star formation, cosmic ray containment within the galaxy, and potentially even galactic evolution. Our research aims to elucidate the effects of vertical outflows in these systems, given their significant influence on gas and magnetic field distributions within galaxies. These outflows play a pivotal role in determining star formation rates and facilitating matter-energy transport processes.  In this study, our goal was to progressively increase $V_z$ over time, thereby leading to the quenching of the dynamo.\n",

    "Unlke Task2 where we discarded velocity terms, here, we include terms with $\\overline V_z$, to study impact of vertical outflows on the evolution of galactic magnetic fields. In particular $\\overline V_z$ is increased with time to show quencing of the dynamo. Then the unitless induction equation is given by \n",
    "$$\\frac{\\partial B_r'}{\\partial t'} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z'}(V_z'B_r') - \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z'}(\\alpha'B_{\\phi}') + \\frac{\\partial^2 B_r'}{\\partial z'^2}$$\n",

    "\n",
    "we have neglected $B_z\\frac{\\partial V_\\phi}{\\partial z}$, and assumed $B_z^2 << B_r^2 + B_\\phi^2$. The solenoidality of $B$ implies that $\\frac{\\partial B_z}{\\partial z} \\approx 0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We expect that with the introduction of an appropriate value or function for $\\overline{V_z}$, the magnetic field will reach saturation over time. In the absence of outflow in $\\overline{V_z}$, the magnetic field initially grows due to the $\\alpha -\\Omega $ effect, and it gradually decays over time. Throughout this project, we experimented with various functions to represent $\\overline{V_z}$ and conducted a comprehensive analysis of the evolution of key parameters. Specifically, we closely examined the behavior of $\\overline{B_{\\phi}}$ and $\\overline{B_r}$, as well as the changes in pitch angle and the average magnitude of the magnetic field, $|\\overline{B}|$, across the spatial domain in the z-direction. By systematically varying $\\overline{V_z}$ and observing its impact on these parameters, we gained valuable insights into the dynamics and stability of the system under study.\n",

    "## **Conclusion**\n",
    "\n",
    "This project explored the influence of different vertical outflow functions $V_z$ on the magnetic field evolution in galactic mean field dynamo theory. We analyzed how these functions impact the long-term behavior of the dynamo process, specifically focusing on magnetic field saturation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our results demonstrate that the choice of the $V_z$ function has a significant effect on the dynamo.Certain functions lead to a decay of the magnetic field over time, while others induce growth. To achieve magnetic field saturation or quenching, the $V_z$ function needs to exhibit characteristics that fall between these two extremes.\n",
    "\n",
    " In conclusion, our investigation highlights the critical role of the vertical outflow in regulating magnetic field growth within the galactic dynamo framework.  Further studies incorporating more complex outflow models and real-world observations can provide a deeper understanding of how vertical outflows govern galactic dynamo activity.\n",
